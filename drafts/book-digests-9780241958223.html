<p><span class="page">6</span>
Great leaders, in contrast, are able to inspire people to act. Those who are able to inspire give people a sense of purpose or belonging that has little to do with any external incentive or benefit to be gained.Those who truly lead are able to create a following of people who act not because they were swayed, but because they were inspired. For those who are inspired, the motivation to act is deeply personal. They are less likely to be swayed by incentives. Those who are inspired are willing to pay a premium or endure inconvenience, even personal suffering. Those who are able to inspire will create a following of people -- supporters, voters, customers, workers -- who act for the good of the whole <span class="hlb">not because they have to, but because they want to</span> .</p>

This book is not designed to tell you what to do or how to do it. Its goal is not to give you a course of action. Its goal is to offer you the <em>cause</em> of action.</p>

<div class="section" id="assume-you-know">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">1. Assume You Know</a></h3>
<p><span class="page">11</span>
We make assumptions about the world around us based on sometimes incomplete or false information.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
This is important because our behaviour is affected by our assumptions of our perceived (被察觉的) truths. <span class="hlb">We make decisions based on what we think we know.</span></p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
This perceived truth impacted behavior. During this period, there was very little exploration. People  <span class="hlr">feared</span> that if they traveled too far they might fall off the edge of the earth.</p>
<p><span class="page">12</span>
The correction of a simple false assumption moved the human race forward.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Regardless of the process or the goals, we all want to make educated (明智的) decisions. More importantly, we all want to make <span class="hlb">right</span> decisions.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Whatever the result, we make decisions based on a perception of the world that may not, in fact, be completely accurate.</p>
<p><span class="page">13</span>
Not only bad decisions are made on false assumptions. Sometimes when things <span class="hlb">go right</span> , we think we <span class="hlb">know why</span> , but do we <span class="hlr">really</span> ? That the result went the way you want does <span class="hlr">not</span>  mean you can <span class="hlb">repeat</span>  it over and over.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
The problem is, we've all been in situations in which we have all the data and get lots of good advice but things still don't go quite right.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
You have to be careful what you think you know. Assumptions, you see, even when based on sound research, can lead us astray (误入歧途) .</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
We understand that even with mountains of data and good advice, if things don't go as expected, it's probably because we missed one, sometimes small but vital (必不可少的) detail.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
There are other factors that must be considered, factors that exist outside of our rational, analytical, information hungry brains.</p>
<p><span class="page">14</span>
The dance between gut and rational decision-making pretty much covers how we conduct business and even live our lives.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
In the Japanese auto plant, they didn't examine the problem and accumulate data to figure out the best solution -- they engineered the outcome they wanted from the beginning. <span class="hlr">If they didn't achieve their desired outcome, they understood it was because of a decision they made at the start of the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
When faced with a result that doesn't go according to a plan, a series of perfectly effective short-term tactics are used until the desired outcome is achieved.</p>
<p><span class="page">15</span>
Even though the outcome may look the same, great leaders understand the value in the things we cannot see.</p>
<p>Every instruction we give, every course of action we set, every result we desire, start with the same thing: a decsion.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Though both of courses of action may yield similar short-term results, <span class="hlb">it is what we can't see that makes long-term success more predictable for only one. The one that understood why the doors need to fit by design and not by default.</span></p>

<p><strong>Manipulation vs. Inspiration</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">16</span>
The reality is, most businesses today are making decisions based on a set of incomplete or, or worse, completely flawed assumptions about what's driving their business.</p>
<p><span class="page">17</span>
There are only two ways to influence human behavior: you can <span class="hlr">manipulate</span> it or you can <span class="hlb">inspire</span> it.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
From business to politics, manipulations run rampant in all forms of sales and marketing. Typical manipulations include: dropping the price; running a promotion; using fear, peer pressure or aspirational message; and promising innovation to influence behavior -- be it a purchase, a vote or support. When companies or organizations do not have a clear sense of why their customers are there customers, they tend to rely on a disproportionate (不成比例的) number of manipulations to get what they need. And for good reason. Manipulations work.</p>
<p><strong>Price</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Many companies are reluctant (不情愿地) to play the price game, but they do so because they know it is effective. So effective, in fact, that the temptation can sometimes be overwhelming.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
No matter how they rationalized it to themselves or their clients, price is highly effective manipulation.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Playing the price game, however, can come at tremendous cost and create a significant dilemma for the company. For the seller, selling based on price is like heroin. The short-term gain is fantastic, but the more you do it, the harder it becomes to the habit.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Price always costs something. The question is, how much are you willing to pay for the money you make?</p>
<p><strong>Fear</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">21</span>
When fear is employed, facts are incidental. Deeply seated in our biological drive to survive, that emotion cannot be quickly wiped away with facts and figures. This is how terrorism works. It's not the statistical probability that one could get hurt by a terrorist, but it's fear that it might happen that cripples a population.</p>
<p>A powerful manipulator, fear is often used with far less nefarious (邪恶的) motivations. We use fear to raise our kids. We use fear to motivate people to obey a code of ethics.</p>
<p><strong>Aspirations</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">22</span>
If fear motivates us to move away from something horrible, aspirational message tempt us toward something desirable.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Though positive in nature, aspirational message are most effective with those who lack discipline or have a nagging (唠叨) fear or insecurity that they don't have the ability to achieve their dreams on their own (which ,at various times for various reasons, is everyone.) I always joke that <span class="hlb">you can get someone to buy a gym membership with an aspirational message, but to get them to go three days a week requires a bit of inspiration.</span> Someone who lives a healthy lifestyle and is in a habit of exercising does not respond to "six easy steps to losing weight." It's those who don't have the lifestyle that are most susceptible (易受影响的).</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Aspirational message can spur (刺激) behavior, but for most, it won't last.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
This short-term response to long-term desires is alive and well in the corporate world also. A management consultant friend of mine was hired by a billion-dollar company to help it fulfill it's goals and aspirations. The problem was, she explained, no matter the issue, the company's managers were <span class="hlb">always drawn to the quicker, cheaper option over the better long-term solution</span> . Just like the habitual dieter, "they never have the time or money to do it right the first time," she said of her client, "but <span class="hlr">they always have the time and money to do it again</span> ."</p>
<p><strong>Peer Pressure</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">25</span>
The practice is designed to do one thing and one thing only -- to pressure you to buy. To make you feel you might be missing out on something or that everyone else knows but you. <span class="hlb">Better to go with the majority, right?</span></p>
<p>To quote my mother, "If your friends put their head in the oven, would you do that too?" Sadly, if Michael Jordan or Tiger Woods was paid to do just that, it might actually start a trend.</p>
<p><strong>Novelty (a.k.a Innovation)</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">26</span>
Like so many before it, the company <span class="hlb">confused</span> innovation with novelty.</p>
<p><span class="hlb">Real</span> innovation changes the course of industries or even society. The light bulb, the microwave oven, the fax machine, iTunes. These are <span class="hlb">true innovations</span> that <span class="hlr">changed how we conduct business</span> , altered how we live our lives, and, in the case of iTunes, challenged an industry to completely reevaluate its business model. Adding a camera to a mobile phone, for example, is not an innovation -- a <span class="hlb">great</span> feature, for sure, but <span class="hlr">not</span> industry-altering.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Motorola had successfully designed the latest shiny object for people to get excited about ... at least until a new shiny object came out. And that's the reason these features are more a novelty than an innovation. They are added in an attempt to differentiate, but <span class="hlr">not reinvent</span> . It's not a bad thing, but it <span class="hlr">can't be counted on to add any long-term value</span> . Novelty can <span class="hlb">drive sales</span> -- the RAZR proved it -- but the impact does not last. If a company adds too many novel ideas too often, it can have a similar impact on the product or category as the price game.</p>
<p><span class="page">27</span>
So much so that even Colgate offers a link on their Web site called "Need Help Deciding?" If Colgate needs to help us pick one of their products because there are too many variations, how are we supposed to decide when we go to the supermarket without their Web site to help us?</p>
<p>Once again, this is an example of the newest set of shiny objects designed to encourage a trail or a purchase. What companies cleverly <span class="hlr">disguise</span> (伪装) as "innovation" is infact novelty. And it's not only packaged goods that rely on novelty to lure customers; it's a common practice in other industries, too. It works, but <span class="hlr">rarely</span> if ever does the strategy cement (粘牢) any <span class="hlb">loyal relationship</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Apple is not only leading how mobile phones are designed, but, in typical Apple fashion, also how the <span class="hlb">industry functions</span> . In the mobile phone industry, it is the <span class="hlb">service provider</span> , <span class="hlr">not</span> the phone manufacture, that <span class="hlr">determines</span> all the feature and benefits the phone can offer. T-Mobile, Verizon Wireless, Sprint, AT&amp;T all dictate to Motorola, Nokia, Ericsson, LG and others what the phones will do. Then Apple showed up. They announced that they would tell the service provider what the phone would do, not the other way around. AT&amp;T was the only one that agreed, thus earning the company the exclusive deal to offer the new technology. That's the kind of <span class="hlb">shift</span> that will impact the industry for <span class="hlb">many years and will extend far beyond a few years</span> of stock boost for the shiny new product.</p>
<p>Novel, huh？</p>
<p><strong>The Price You Pay for the Money You Make</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">28</span>
I cannot dispute that manipulations work. Every one of them can indeed help influence behavior and every one of them can help a company become quite successful. But there are trade-offs. Not a single one of them breeds loyalty. Over the course of time, they cost more and more. They gains are only short-term.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span></p>
<p>Beyond the business world, manipulations are the norm in politics today as well. Just as manipulations can drive a sale but <span class="hlr">not create loyalty</span> , so too can they help a candidate get elected, but they <span class="hlr">don't create a foundation for leadership</span> . Leadership requires people to stick with you through thick and thin.  <span class="hlr">Leadership is the ability to rally on people not for a single event, but for years.</span> In business, leadership means that customers will continue to support your company even when you slip up. If manipulation is the only strategy, what happens the next time a purchase decision is required?</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
There is a big difference between business and loyalty. <span class="hlb">Repeat business</span> is when people do business with you multiple times.  <span class="hlb">Loyalty</span> is when people are willing to turn down a better product or a better price to continue doing business with you. Loyal customers often don't even bother to research the competition or entertain other options. Loyalty is not easily won. Repeat business, however, is. All it takes is more manipulations.</p>
<p><span class="page">29</span>
The short-term tactics have become so sophisticated that an entire economy has developed to service the manipulations, equipped with statistics and <span class="hlr">quasi-science</span>  (准科学).</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
To make them profitable, manufacturers rely on the breakage and slippage numbers staying above a certain threshold. Just like our trusty drug addict, whose behavior is reinforced by how good the short-term high feels, the temptation to make the qualifications of the rebate more obscure (朦胧) or cumbersome (繁琐) so as to reduce the number of qualified applicants can be overwhelming for some.</p>
<p><strong>Manipulations Lead to Transactions, Not Loyalty</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">31</span>
Given that most people to be any head-to-head comparisons made to the other services. All they needed to do was drive a purchase decision and offer a pleasant enough experience that people would recommend it to a friend. Any more was unnecessary.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Manipulations are a perfectly valid strategy for driving a transaction, or for any behavior that is only required once or on rare occasions.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
In any circumstance in which a person or organization wants <span class="hlb">more than a single transaction</span> , however, if there is a hope for a loyal, lasting relationship, <span class="hlb">manipulations do not help</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">32</span>
Though  <span class="hlb">loyal customers</span> are less tempted by other offers and incentives, in good times the free flow of business makes it <span class="hlr">hard</span> to recognize them value. It's in the tough times that loyal customers matter most.</p>
<p>Manipulations work, but they cost money. Lots of money. When the money is not as available to fund those tactics, not having a loyal following really hurts.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Knowing you have a loyal customer and employee base not only reduce costs, it <span class="hlr">provides massive peace of mind</span> . Like loyal friends, you know your customers and employees will be there for you when you need them most. It is the feeling of "we're in this together," shared between customer and company, voter and candidate, boss and employee, that defines great leaders.</p>
<p>In contrast, relying on manipulations creates massive stress for buyer and seller alike.</p>
<p><span class="page">33</span>
All the advertising, promotions and pressure employed to temp us one way or another, each attempting to push harder than the other to court (追求) us for our money or support, ultimately yields one consistent result: stress.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
The short-term gains that drive business in America today are actually destorying our health.</p>
<p><strong>Just Because It Works Doesn't Make It Right</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">34</span>
The fact that alone <span class="hlb">creates a systemic peer pressure</span> . With perfect irony (讽刺), we, the manipulators, have been manipulated by our own system. With every price drop, promotion, fear-based or aspirational message, and novelty we use to achieve our goals, we find our companies, our organizations and our systems getting weaker and weaker.</p>

<div class="section" id="the-golden-cycle">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">3. The Golden Cycle</a></h3>
<p>There are a few leaders who choose to inspire rather than manipulate in order to motivate people. Whether individuals or organizations, every single one of these inspiring leader thinks, acts, and communicates exactly the same way. And it's the complete opposite of the rest of us. Consciously or not, how they do it is by following a naturally occurring pattern that I call the Golden Cycle.</p>
<p><span class="page">39</span></p>
<p><span class="hlb">WHAT</span> : Every single company and organization on the planet know WHAT they do. This is true no matter how big or small, no matter what industry. Everyone is easily able to describe the products or services a company sells or the job function they have within that system. WHATs are easily to identify.</p>
<p><span class="hlb">HOW</span> : Some companies and people know HOW they do WHAT they do. Whether you call them a "differentiating value proposition (主张)", "proprietary process" or "unique selling proposition," HOWs are often given to explain how something is different or better. Not as obvious as WHATs, many think these are the differentiating or motivating factors in a decision. It would be false to assume that's all is required. There is one missing detail:</p>
<p><span class="hlr">WHY</span> : Very few people or companies can clearly articulate WHY they do WHAT they do. When I say WHY, I don't mean to make money -- that's a result. By WHY I mean what is your <span class="hlr">purpose, cause or belief</span> ? WHY does your company exist? WHY do you get out of bed every morning? And WHY should anyone care?</p>
<p><span class="page">41</span>
This time, the example starts with WHY.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everything we do, we believe in challenging the status quo (现状). We believe in thinking differently.</p>
<p>The we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly.</p>
<p>And we happen to make great computers.</p>
<p>Wanna buy one?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
There's no trickery, no manipulation, no free stuff, no aspirational message, no celebrities.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
The example starts to prove that people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.</p>
<p>It's worth repeating: <span class="hlr">people don't buy WHAT you do, they buy WHY you do it.</span></p>
<p><span class="page">42</span>
When communicating from the inside out, however, <span class="hlb">the WHY is offered as the reason to buy and the WHATs serve as the tangible proof of that belief.</span>  The things we can point to rationalize or explain the reasons we're drawn to one product, company or idea over another.</p>
<p>WHAT companies do are external factors, but WHY they do it is something deeper.</p>
<p><span class="page">43</span>
<span class="hlb">Everything they do works to demonstrate their WHY</span> , to challenge the status quo. Regardless of the products they make or industry in which they operate, it is always clear that Apple "thinks different."</p>
<p><span class="page">45</span>
The same cannot be said for companies with a fuzzy sense of WHY. When an organization defines itself by WHAT it does, that's all it will ever be able to do.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
The problem was they had defined themselves by WHAT they did; they made computers, and it simply didn't make sense to us to buy a PDA or mp3 player from them. <span class="hlr">It didn't feel right</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Apple, unlike its competitors, has defined by WHY it does things, not WHAT it does. It is not a computer company, but a company that <span class="hlb">challenges the status quo</span>  and offers individuals <span class="hlb">simpler alternatives</span> .  Apple even changed its legal name in 2007 from Apple Computer, Inc. to Apple Inc. to reflect the fact that they were more than just a computer company.  <span class="hlb">Practically speaking</span> , it doesn't really matter what a company's legal name is. For Apple, however, having the world "Computer" in their name didn't limit WHAT they could do. It limited how they thought of themselves. The change <span class="hlb">wasn't practical</span> , it was <span class="hlr">philosophical</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">46</span>
Apple's WHY was formed at its founding in the late 1970s and hasn't changed to this date. Regardless of the products they make or the industries into which they migrate, their WHY still remains a constant. And Apple's intention to challenge accepted thinking has proved prophetic (预言的).</p>
<p><span class="page">47</span>
This is largely the pattern for almost every other product or service on the market today, business-to-customer or business-to-business. They focus on WHAT they do and HOW they do it without consideration of WHY; we lump them together and they act like commodities.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Companies and organization with a clear sense of WHY never worry about it. They don't "convince" anyone of their value. They don't need complex systems of carrots and sticks. They <em>are</em> different, and everyone knows it. They <span class="hlr">start with WHY in everything</span> they <span class="hlr">say</span> and they <span class="hlr">do</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">48</span>
The products they choose become <span class="hlb">proof of WHY</span>  they do the things they do.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Like the products the company produces that serve as proof of the company's WHY, so too does a brand or product <span class="hlb">serve as proof</span>  of an <span class="hlr">individual's</span> <span class="hlb">WHY</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
But a company <span class="hlb">doesn't need</span> to have the best products, they just need to be good or very good. Better or best is a relative comparison. <span class="hlr">Without first understanding WHY</span> , the <span class="hlr">comparison</span>  itself is of <span class="hlr">no value</span> to the <span class="hlb">decision maker</span> .</p>
<p>The concept of "better" begs the question: based on what standard?</p>
<p><span class="page">49</span>
Even with objective metrics in hand, the argument about which is better or which is worse <span class="hlr">without first establishing a common standard</span>  creates nothing more than <span class="hlb">debate</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
It's not a debate about better or worse anymore, it's a discussion about different needs. And <span class="hlr">before</span> the discussion can even happen, the WHYs for each must be established <span class="hlr">first</span> .</p>
<p>A simple claim of better, even with the rational evidence to back it up, can create desire and even motivate a decision to buy, but it doesn't create loyalty. If a customer <span class="hlr">feels inspired</span> to buy a product, rather than manipulated, they will be able to <span class="hlb">verbalize the reasons</span> why they think what they bought is better.
Good quality and features matter, but they are <span class="hlr">not enough</span> to produce the <span class="hlb">dogged loyalty</span> that all the inspiring leaders and companies are able to command. It is the cause that is represented by the company, brand, product or person that inspires loyalty.</p>
<p><strong>Not the Only Way, Just One Way</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">50</span>
Knowing your WHY is not the only way to be successful, but it is the <span class="hlr">only</span> way to maintain a lasting success and have a greater blend (混合) of innovation and flexibility. When a WHY goes fuzzy, it becomes much more difficult to maintain the growth, loyalty and <span class="hlb">inspiration</span> that helped drive the <span class="hlb">original success</span> . Buy <span class="hlb">difficult</span> , I mean that manipulation rather than inspiration fast becomes the strategy of choice to motivate behavior. This is effective in the short term but comes at a high cost in the long term.</p>

In all cases, going back to the original purpose, cause or belief will help these industries adapt. Instead of asking, "WHAT should we do to complete?" the question must be asked, "WHY did we starting doing WHAT we're doing in the first place, and WHAT can we do to bring our cause to life considering all the technologies and market opportunities available today?" But don't take my word for it. Non of this is my opinion. It is all <span class="hlb">firmly grounded</span> in the tenets (原理,信条) of biology.</p>

<p><span class="page">53</span>
Our need to <span class="hlb">belong</span> is not rational, but it is a constant that exists across <span class="hlb">all</span> people in <span class="hlb">all</span> cultures. It is a <span class="hlb">feeling</span> we get when those around us share our <span class="hlb">values and beliefs</span> . When we feel like we belong we feel connected and we feel safe. As human we crave (渴望) the feeling and we seek it out.</p>
<p>Sometimes our feeling of belonging is incidental.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
We're not friends with everyone from our home state, but travel across the country, and you'll feel a special bond with someone you meet who is from your home state.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
<span class="hlr">No matter we where we go, we trust those with whom we are able to perceive</span> (感知) <span class="hlr">common value or beliefs.</span></p>
<p>Our desire to feel like we belong is so powerful that we will go to great length, do irrational things and often spend money to get that feeling.</p>
<p><span class="page">54</span>
This is not because they are better, but because they become makers or symbols of the values and beliefs we hold dear (珍视).</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Our <span class="hlb">nature need</span> to belong also makes us good at spotting things that <span class="hlr">don't</span> belong. It's sense we get. <span class="hlb">A feeling</span> . Something deep inside us, something we can't put into words, allows us to feel how somethings just fit and some things just don't.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Apple defines itself as a company on a <span class="hlb">mission</span> and so anything they do that <span class="hlr">fits</span>  that definition <span class="hlr">feels</span> like it belongs.</p>
<p><span class="page">55</span>
One is better or worse; it <span class="hlb">depends on</span>  where you <span class="hlb">feel like you belong</span>. Are you a rabble-rouser or are you with the majority?</p>
<p>We are drawn to leaders and organizations that are <span class="hlb">good at communicating what they believe</span> . There ability to make us <span class="hlb">feel like</span> we belong, to make us <span class="hlb">feel special</span> , safe and not alone is part of what gives them the ability to draw us close and to command our <span class="hlb">loyalty</span> . And we <span class="hlb">feel</span> a strong bond with those who are also drawn to the same leaders and organizations.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
They know they belonged together because they could feel it in their gut.</p>
<p><strong>Gut Decision Don't Happen in Your Stomach</strong></p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
The principles of the Golden Circle are much more than a communication hierarchy. Its principles are deeply grounded in the evolution of human behaviour. The power of WHY is not opinion, it's <span class="hlb">biology</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">56</span>
The part of the brain that controls our feelings has no capacity for language. It is disconnection that makes putting our feeling into words so hard.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Rationally, we know our explanation <span class="hlr">isn't</span> the real reason. It is how our loved ones make us feel, but those feelings are really hard to put into words.</p>
<p><span class="page">57</span>
The same is <span class="hlr">true</span> for other decisions. When a decision <span class="hlr">feels right</span> , we have a hard time explaining why we did what we did.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Decision-making and the ability to explain those decisions exist in different parts of the brain.</p>
<p>This is where "gut decisions" come from. They <span class="hlb">just feel</span> right. There is no part of the stomach that controls decision-making, it all happens in the limbic brain (脑边缘) .</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Our limbic brains is powerful, powerful enough to drive behavior that sometimes contradicts (反驳，抵触) our rational and analytical understanding of a situation. We often trust our gut even if the decision flies in the face of all the facts and figures.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
These rational decisions tend to take longer to make, says Restak, and can often be of lower quality. In contrast, decisions make with the limbic brain, gut decisions, tend to be faster, higher-quality decisions. This one of the primary reasons why teachers tell students to go with their first instinct when taking a multiple-choice test, to test their gut. The more time spent thinking about the answer, the bigger risk that it may be the wrong one. Our limbic brains are smart and often know the right thing to do. It is our inability to verbalize the reasons that may cause us to doubt ourselves or trust the empirical (经验) evidence when our gut tells us not to.</p>
<p><span class="page">59</span>
Those decisions started with WHY -- <span class="hlr">the emotional component of the decision</span> -- and then the rational components allowed the buyer to verbalize or rationalize the reasons for their decisions.</p>
<p>This is what we mean when we talk about winning hearts and minds. The heart represents the limbic, feeling part of the brain, and the mind is rational, language center.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Winning hearts, however, takes more work.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Quality. Service. Price. Features. That's what the data reported. But for the fact that the part of the brain that controls decision-making is different from the part of the brain that is able to report back that decision, it would be perfectly valid conclusion to give people what they ask for.</p>
<p><span class="page">60</span>
Henry Ford summed it up best. "If I had asked people what they wanted," he said, "they would have said a faster horse."</p>
<p>This is <span class="hlb">the genius of great leadership</span> . Great leaders and great organizations are goo dat seeing what most of us can't see. <span class="hlb">They are good at giving us things we would never think of asking for.</span></p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Great leaders are those who trust their gut. They are those who <span class="hlb">understand the art before the science</span> . They <span class="hlb">win hearts before minds</span> . They are the ones who start with WHY.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
We <span class="hlb">trust our gut</span> to help us decide whom to vote for or which shampoo to buy.</p>
<p><span class="hlr">It's What You Can't See That Matters</span></p>
<p><span class="page">61</span>
The data is true, but the <span class="hlr">truth</span> of what people wanted was <span class="hlr">different</span> .</p>
<p><span class="page">62</span>
If we were all rational, there would be no small businesses, there would be no exploration, there would be very little innovation and there would be no great leaders to inspire all those things. It is the undying belief in something bigger and better that drives that kind of behavior. But it also control behavior born out of other emotions, like hate or fear. Why else would someone plot to hurt someone they had never met?</p>
<p><span class="page">63</span>
Ask them WHY they love their Mac. They won't tell you.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
In reality, their purchase decision and their loyalty are deeply personal. They don't really care about Apple; it's <span class="hlr">all</span>  about them.</p>
<p><span class="page">64</span>
It's an <span class="hlr">emblem</span> (象征), a symbol of who they are.</p>

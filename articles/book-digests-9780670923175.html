<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">FOREWORD</a></h2>
<p><span class="pre-page">VIIII</span>
In <em>Leaders Eat Last</em>, Simon Sinek does not propose any new leadership theory or core principle. He has a much higher purpose to his writing. Simon would like to make the world a better place for all of us. His vision is simple: to create a new generation of men and women who understand that an organization's success or failure is based on leadership excellence and not managerial acumen (精明管理).</p>
<p>It is not an accident that Simon uses the U.S. military, and in particular the United States Marine Corps, to explain the importance of leaders being focused on their people. These organizations have strong cultures and shared values, understand the importance of teamwork, create trust among their members, maintain focus, and, most important, understand the importance of people and relationships to their success. The organizations are also in a position where the cost of failure can be catastrophic (灾难性的).</p>
<p><span class="pre-page">.</span>
When you are with Marines gathering to eat, you will notice that the most junior are served first and the most senior are served last. When you witness this act, you will also note that no order is given. Marines just do it.</p>
<p><span class="pre-page">X</span>
Great leaders truly care about those they are privileged to lead and understand that the true cost of the leadership privilege comes at the expense of self-interest.</p>
<p><span class="pre-page">.</span>
Simply stated, it is not enough to be a good leader; good leaders must truly care about those entrusted (托付) to their care.</p>
<p><span class="pre-page">.</span>
<span class="hlr">"If you actions inspire others to dream more, do more and become more, you are a leader."</span></p>
<p><span class="pre-page">.</span>
When leaders inspire those they lead, people dream of a better future, invest time and effort in learning more, do more for their organizations and along the way become leaders themselves. <span class="hlr">A leader who takes care of their people and stays focused on the well-being of the organization can never fail.</span></p>

<div class="section" id="protection-from-above">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">1. Protection from Above</a></h3>
<p><span class="center-strong">The Value of Empathy</span>
<span class="page">8</span>
We raise our hands for recognition and reward. For most of us, the more recognition we get for our efforts from those in charge, the more successful we think we are.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
For Jonny Bravo and those like him, the will to succeed and the desire to do things that advance the interests of the organization <span class="hlr">aren't just motivated by recognition</span> from above, they are integral (的组成部分) to a culture of sacrifice and service, in which protection comes from all levels of the organization.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Ask any of the remarkable men and women in uniform who risk themselves for the benefit of others why they do it and they will tell you the same thing: "Because they would have done it for me."</p>
<p><span class="page">9</span>
And when that happens, when those kinds of bonds are formed, a strong foundation is laid for the kindness of success and fulfillment that no amount of money, fame or awards can buy. This is what it means to work in a place in which the leaders <span class="hlb">prioritize the well-bing of their people</span>  and, in return, their people give everything they've got to protect and advance the well-being of one another and the organization.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
There is a pattern that exists in the organizations that achieve the greatest success, the ones that outmaneuver (胜出) and outinnovate（创新超越） their competitors, the ones that command the greatest respect from inside and outside their organizations, the ones with the highest loyalty and lowest churn and the ability to weather nearly every storm or challenge.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
This is the reason they are willing to push hard and take the kinds of risks they do. And the way any organization can achieve this is with empathy.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">2. Employees Are People Too</a></h3>
<p><span class="page">11</span>
As he did with every company he acquired, he started by sitting down to hear what employees had to say.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
"First of all," Campbell asked, "if I tell the truth, will I still have a job tomorrow?" Chapman smiled. "If you have any trouble tomorrow about what you say today," he assured him, "you give me a call."</p>
<p><span class="page">12</span>
No matter how much effort they put in, those who stood by the machines didn't feel like the company trusted them simply because they stood on a factory floor instead of sitting at desks.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
Preferring to see everyone as human instead of as a factory worker or office employee, Chapman made others changes so that everyone would be treated the same way.</p>
<p><span class="page">13</span>
<span class="hlb">Every employee would be treated the same way regardless of whether they worked in the administrative offices or on the factory floor. This was going to be the new normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
They felt like they belonged and that enabled them to relax and feel valued. People started to care for others as they felt cared for. This caring environment allowed people to fully engage "their heads and hearts," as Chapman likes to say, and the organization began to thrive.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
"When you have people who trust you, they're going to do a better job for you to earn or keep that trust."</p>
<p><span class="page">14</span>
Without coercion (强迫), pressure or force, the people naturally work together to help each other and advance the company. Working with a sense of obiligation (义务, 职责) is replaced by working with a sense of pride. And coming to work for the company is replaced by coming to work for each other. <span class="hlr">Work is no longer a place to dread (恐惧). It's a place to feel valued.</span></p>
<p><span class="center-strong">We See What We Want to See</span>
<span class="page">15</span>
Up until the day, Chapman had been exactly the kind of executive we teach our MBAs to be. He was good with numbers and he loved the game of business. He made decision based on data, market conditions and financial opportunities.</p>
<p><span class="page">.</span>
He thought business was something that was measured on spreadsheets, and he saw people as one of the many assets he had to manage to help him achieve his financial goals. And as that kind of executive, he was very effective.</p>
